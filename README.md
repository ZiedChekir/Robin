# Introduction 

Robin Mania is a community driven 2D multiplayer RPG game combining adventure, action and story into one place. You can join with your friends or discover new ones in the game to do quests, challenges and interesting battles. The game items are NFTs that you can freely trade, buy or sell with anyone on the blockchain. You can also participate in decision making through our DAO.

# Technical details


We made 3 smart contracts using hardhat for development, testing and deploying on test network. One smart contract is for the game items, one for the NFT Marketplace and another for auctions. We also built some game features using Unity game engine and we made our own plugin to interact with the blockchain through webGL.


# What's next for RobinMania

The first thing on our list is making a DAO for the game, this includes making the game token and allocating 23% for the DAO treasury and getting early funding. In parallel we will be optimizing the game, adding multiplayer features, ERC721 NFTs for characters, upgrading the map and receiving feedback from the community. The second step will be deploying a beta version for the public on mainnet, gathering initial player base and marketing the game. The third step is getting the game token listed on major crypto exchanges. And the last step is making the project more and more community driven and decentralized allowing players and DAO members to make decisions.
